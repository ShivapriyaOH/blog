        <title>Vargas Plateau</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Vargas plateau is one of the East Bay parks in the Fremont hills. It overlooks Niles Canyon, Fremont, Union city and San Francisco Bay beyond. We went hiking during the month of March 2019 when California in general had good showers during Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
