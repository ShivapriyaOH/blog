	     <p>Drycreek Pioneer regional park is one of the East Bay parks located in Union city. For more information about the park visit their <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/garin/default.htm">website</a>. It was a bit tricky to find the parking lot as there is no designated visitor center for this park. You should search for ‘Dry creek staging area’ in the Google maps. Even the trails are not well marked. We got lost quite a bit and took multiple trails to finish the hike. But overall it was a nice mix of open area, steep climb and shaded regions to hike. It has light traffic but we did see many people hiking. It also gets confusing because the Dry creek regional park continues into Garin regional park without any demarcation. The ‘Park Headquarters’ signs were misleading at a few places since it was leading to Garin regional park but not Dry creek regional park, where we started our hike. So, we need to be careful while navigating within the park. I wish they had clearer sign boards.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Where is it</strong> 
Do not search for the trailhead as you will be taken to another place where there is no parking. You need to search for ‘Dry creek staging area’.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best Time of the year to Visit</strong>: During Spring after the showers when meadows have turned green</li>
  <li><strong>Best Time of the day to visit</strong>: The park opens at 8am. ![Entrance]</li>
  <li><strong>Parking</strong>: There are not many spots. There may be aroubd 20 spots in the staging area</li>
  <li><strong>Trail details</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Trail name: High ridge loop trail + Pioneer trail + Meyers Ranch trail
<img src="assets/images/drycreek/trailmap.png" alt="trail map" /></li>
      <li>Strenuous level: Easy</li>
      <li>Total round trip: 3.5 miles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Things to keep in mind</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Restroom: There is just one small portable toilet at the staging area</li>
      <li>Carry enough water to keep yourself hydrated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More details on the hikes in the park can be found in this <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=24310">map</a></p>

<p>The view from the top is of the Bay Area cities below the hill.</p>

<p>Waypoints:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The hike begins from the staging area although it’s not the trail head for High ridge loop trail. We pass the Dry creek apartments and take a right turn at the gate to the park
<img src="assets/images/drycreek/1.jpg" alt="1" />
<img src="assets/images/drycreek/2.jpg" alt="2" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start climbing up the High Ridge loop trail although there is no board. You need to bear left and climb up the hill. It is a rugged path.
<img src="assets/images/drycreek/3.jpg" alt="3" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After about a mile you will reach the summit with views of the bustling city
<img src="assets/images/drycreek/4.jpg" alt="4" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the top, you see a gate which may be blocked by cattle. Although they seemed to be observant and threatening at times, we could walk pass them. They don’t do anything. 
<img src="assets/images/drycreek/gate.jpg" alt="gate" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The high ridge trail becomes Pioneer trail and is almost a flat region to hike. It goes within a forest with shade for almost a mile. Keep following signs for Pioneer trail.
<img src="assets/images/drycreek/pioneer.jpg" alt="pioneer" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we followed Meyer’s Ranch trail so as to get back to the parking lot without having to cross the Dry Creek regional park into Garin Regional Park.
<img src="assets/images/drycreek/meyers.jpg" alt="meyers" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Overall it was not a strenuous hike but it had elevation for the initial part of the hike making it a good workout. I would recommend this if you need a short hike with good views.</p>

Flaghill summit is 1.3 miles and 900 feet above the Sunol headquarters. It’s a tough climb up to the top but it gets over soon.</p>

<p>The view from the top is one of the best in the Bay Area. It is a very peaceful place with hardly any noise.</p>

<p>Waypoints:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The hike begins from the trailhead behind the headquarters. Take the bridge behind the barn across the Alameda Creek. Turn left turn and walk till you see a sign for Flag hill trail. 
<img src="assets/images/sunol/1.jpg" alt="1" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start climbing up toward Flag hill. This climb is steep and rocky in a few places. 
<img src="assets/images/sunol/6.jpg" alt="6" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After about a mile you will reach the summit
<img src="assets/images/sunol/flag_hilltop.jpg" alt="3" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the summit, go ahead to explore the rocks. There is a bench from which the views of the Sunol region is breath taking.

	     <p>Garin regional park is one of the East Bay parks. It was the best place to see wild flowers blooming all along our path. For more information about the park visit their <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/garin/default.htm">website</a>. Extremely light on traffic early in the morning. People started coming late for a picnic with family. We saw hardly 10 people hiking in this huge park. They were all spread out. It was a peaceful hike with byfar the most number of sightings of animals/birds in a local hike in Bay area. We saw a lot of cows, by now we have concluded that we had underestimated the timid looking cows. We learnt our lesson to keep our distance from them. Apart from the cows, we also saw a bunch of turkeys on the way. As we came close to the end of our trail we also spotted 2-3 coyotes running from the top of the mountain to the bottom. We were 10ft away from the coyotes. That was fun !</p>

  <li><strong>Best Time of the year to Visit</strong>: During Spring after the showers when meadows have turned green</li>
  <li><strong>Best Time of the day to visit</strong>: The park opens at 8am. The park visitor center opens at 11:30am. <img src="assets/images/garin/entrance2.jpg" alt="Entrance" /></li>
  <li><strong>Parking</strong>: Sufficient parking spots, not to worry</li>
  <li><strong>Trail details</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Trail name: Vista Peak Loop trail.</li>
      <li>Strenuous level: Moderate</li>
      <li>Total round trip: 4miles</li>

      <li>Restrooms are only at the trailhead in the parking lot.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We started hiking at around 8am in the morning. A carpet of yellow wild flowers had been laid for us. Garin has some rustic metallic structures at the entrance, they were interesting.
<img src="assets/images/garin/entrance1.jpg" alt="Entrance1" />
 It is a bit easy to get lost while trying to find the Vista Peak Loop trail. You have to walk straight ahead from the parking lot, not entering into the main area.
<img src="assets/images/garin/2.jpg" alt="Vista trailhead" />
The restrooms are found inside the park. But keep in mind the trail head is outside the park, next to parking lot.
<img src="assets/images/garin/entrance2.jpg" alt="entrance2" />
 We saw many people on the High Ridge trail which looked hard to me since the mountain was very steep. We chose a moderate hike but we didn’t realize that none would choose this trail and we would be alone on this trail. 
More details on the hikes in the park can be found in this <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/images/Parks/Garin/Garin_map_2250w-20180404.gif">map</a></p>

<p>As you climb the peak, there will be boards pointing to different trails.
<img src="assets/images/garin/4.jpg" alt="other trails" />
There is a pattern in the East Bay parks. They are all vast expanse of green meadows if you go during Spring. There are hardly any trees for shade. It may get hot during the Summer and I would imagine the grass would turn yellow making it even more difficult to hike. So the best time to hike is again during the Spring and it is undoubtedly our favourite season to hike.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/garin/7.jpg" alt="greenery" /></p>

<p>Unlike the heavily crowded Mission Peak, I would say that the lightly treaded Garin Regional Park has all kinds of trails both easy and difficult. It is cut off from the freeways and extremely peaceful to get away for the weekend. Pack some food, picnic towel and chairs with family and friends. You will have get to relax after the hike and have some fun time. I will definitely make it a regular ritual to visit this place. Will you ? :)</p>

<p>Listen to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_q9IXvt3ro">song</a> for the brain while it is thinking whether to go or not. Bring out the child in you and have fun.</p>

	     <p>Vargas plateau is one of the East Bay parks in the Fremont hills. It overlooks Niles Canyon, Fremont, Union city and San Francisco Bay beyond. We went hiking during the month of March 2019 when California in general had good showers during Spring.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best Time of the year to Visit</strong>: During Spring after the showers when the meadows have turned green</li>
  <li><strong>Best Time of the day to visit</strong>: The park opens promptly at 8am</li>
  <li><strong>How to get there</strong>: If you come on 680, we need to take the Vargas Road exit and drive uphill on Morris Canyon Road</li>
</ul>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d12655.46078836287!2d-121.93872812877207!3d37.575643088895006!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x808fc109baa0c0bd%3A0xd9386b9e4a587286!2sVargas+Plateau+Regional+Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1556772177576!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Parking</strong>: The entrance has around 20 car parking spaces.  <img src="assets/images/vargas/vargas_parking.jpg" alt="Parking" /></li>
  <li><strong>Trail details</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Trail name: Golden Eagle Trail and Deer Gulch trail</li>
      <li>Strenuous level: Easy</li>
      <li>Total round trip: 4miles</li>
      <li>Elevation: Not too steep</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Things to keep in mind</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Restrooms are only at the trailhead in the parking lot.</li>
      <li>It can have large puddles of muddy water in the trail which you may have to jump and go</li>
      <li>Beware of cattle which may get aggressive if you are alone. Better to go in a large group.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We reached the trailhead at 7am only to realize that the gates open at 8am. We stayed in the car wondering if we should take a different trail but decided to stay and wait. To our utter surprise, a car pulled over just next to our car and a lady came running to open the lock on the gates. Although she was right on time at 8am, she apologized and was on her way out again. The wait was worth it to witness people keeping time and value others’ time on a nice Saturday weekend morning. :)
<img src="assets/images/vargas/vargas_3.jpg" alt="Trailhead" /></p>

<p>We started with the Golden Eagle trail. We had planned to take a small detour to a view point. We had to jump cross the muddy puddles at a few places but it was not that baduntil we reached the point where we had to take a fork to reach the viewpoint according to trail map. We saw many pairs of eyes silently staring at us as we approached the entrance to the view point. Well, they didn’t look happy and welcoming. We decided to skip the view point and continue on our journey. We didn’t want to enrage the original inhabitants of the plateau.
<img src="assets/images/vargas/vargas_4.jpg" alt="Cowblock" /></p>

<p>We get a nice view of the city from the top with lots of cows grazing around which ultimately became a threat for our mission to complete the hike. 
<img src="assets/images/vargas/vargas_5.jpg" alt="Cityview" /></p>

<p>It is a pity that we could not finish the predetermined trail since we were the only ones walking while there was a group of rather angry looking cows almost ready to charge at us. We had to come back, couldn’t have risked, we being like the tiny lilliputs in front of the huge animals. We could have got trapped with nowhere to go.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/vargas/vargas_6.jpg" alt="Summit" /></p>

<p>We saw as we reached the parking lot and ended our hike that there was a board at the entrance which we conveniently ignored. It had instructions to follow when we encounter cattle in our way.
<img src="assets/images/vargas/vargas_notice.jpg" alt="Notice" /></p>

<p>If you start with Golden Eagle trail and continue on the Deer Gulch trail to the end to see the views of Bay Area, it completes exactly 2 miles. Total round trip would then be 4miles with not so much of elevation. I highly recommend going there with a large group of people on a nice Spring day to this beautiful green pastures in the East Bay.
Vargas is away from the hustle bustle of the city and you would find an overload of greenery around you. A breath of fresh air, the vast blue skies are all yours to explore.</p>

<p>As goes this <a href="https://www.filmyquotes.com/songs/128">refreshing song</a> in Hindi,</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>“Tere liye nayi hai zameen naya aasmaan ,Likh de hawaon pe koi nayi dastaan” –&gt;  “The earth and the sky are new for you, So write a new story in the air”</em></li>
</ul>

	     <p>Mission Peak is one of the most popular hikes in the Bay Area if you are looking for some challenge. It is pretty crowded. We went hiking during the month of January when there were showers and there were green grass pastures for the cows to feed on.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Where is it</strong></li>
</ul>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3165.1523873283336!2d-121.91058768476928!3d37.50432387980952!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x808fc67dccda1b0d%3A0x7231f5f4d748bf62!2sMission+Peak+Trail+Head!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1557789582065!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best Time of the year to Visit</strong>: During Spring after the showers when meadows have turned green</li>
  <li><strong>Best Time of the day to visit</strong>: The park opens at 6:30am itself and there will be people climbing up late into the day as well. But if you want to beat the sun, go as early as possible. <img src="assets/images/mission_peak/1b.jpg" alt="Entrance" /></li>
  <li><strong>Parking</strong>: There are two entrances- Ohlone college and Stanford entrance. The one in Stanford entrance has around 20 car parking spaces. Better to carpool.</li>
  <li><strong>Trail details</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Trail name: Hidden Valley trail one the way up, crossing Horse heaven on the way and Peak Meadow trail while coming down</li>
      <li>Strenuous level: Hard</li>
      <li>Total round trip: 6miles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Things to keep in mind</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Restrooms are only at the trailhead in the parking lot.</li>
      <li>Carry enough water to keep yourself hydrated</li>
      <li>It gets windy at the top, so carry wind jacket</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We started hiking at around 6:45am in the morning with the sun peeking out slowly. The sky had turned violet and it was a bit chilly. It reminds me of a soulful <a href="http://kannadasongtranslation.blogspot.com/2015/07/munjaane-manjalli.html">Kannada song</a> as we see the mighty sun rising, all the mist slowly vanishes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>“Munjaane manjalli…” –&gt; “In the mist of dawnbreak…”</em></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="assets/images/mission_peak/1.jpg" alt="Sunrise" /></p>

<p>We started with the Hidden Valley trail and the elevation picks up pretty soon with multiple switchbacks. It is one of the tough hikes in the Bay Area for a reason.
<img src="assets/images/mission_peak/1c.jpg" alt="Trailhead" /></p>

<p>We get a nice view of the city beneath the Mission Peak. Lots of cows grazing around but they were not bothered by the large crowd that went up and down the hill. Once you reach the top, it really feels mission accomplished to take the picture with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Peak#Iconic_%22Mission_Peeker%22_summit_pole">“Mission Peeker”</a>. It is an iconic pole installed in 1990 with time capsules containing articles and photographs inside it, to be opened after 2090.</p>

<p>It was a special day for Indians that day. It was January 26th 2019, the Republic Day and a group of fellow Indians hoisted the Tricolor Indian flag at the Mission Peeker. Felt proud to see it hoisted on top of the Mission Peak, always arouses the patriotism in you, the Indian-ness in you.
<img src="assets/images/mission_peak/4.jpg" alt="Summit" /></p>

<p>After getting some rest and having an energy bar we felt re-energized to climb down the peak. This time we decided to beat the crowd by taking a different trail - Peak Meadows trail. It is on the other side of the Mission Peeker. We confirmed that there was indeed a path to take us to the Stanford entrance from the people who just came to the top. They were more exhausted from the climb than us. As we climbed down we realized that this trail was steeper than on the trail that we took while coming up. Lesser people on this trail. But if you are not in shape, I recommend not to take this trail while climbing up.</p>

<p>The views of the green meadows are just breathtaking. I dread coming here in Summer where the grass would have completely dried up with Sun heating up in the morning.
<img src="assets/images/mission_peak/5.jpg" alt="Meadows" /></p>

<p>If you do Hidden Valley trail while climbing up and Peak Meadow trail while coming down, then it takes a total of 6miles. Climb at your own pace and don’t be demoralized by some athletes who will be running up and down multiple times while you are struggling to catch a breath while climbing up once. :) 
Go up the peak, enjoy the winds, the views below and more than anything you would indeed be ecstatic to be finishing the Mission.</p>
