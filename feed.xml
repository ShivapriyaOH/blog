        <title>Drycreek Pioneer Regional Park</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Drycreek Pioneer regional park is one of the East Bay parks located in Union city. For more information about the park visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebparks.org/parks/garin/default.htm&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. It was a bit tricky to find the parking lot as there is no designated visitor center for this park. You should search for ‘Dry creek staging area’ in the Google maps. Even the trails are not well marked. We got lost quite a bit and took multiple trails to finish the hike. But overall it was a nice mix of open area, steep climb and shaded regions to hike. It has light traffic but we did see many people hiking. It also gets confusing because the Dry creek regional park continues into Garin regional park without any demarcation. The ‘Park Headquarters’ signs were misleading at a few places since it was leading to Garin regional park but not Dry creek regional park, where we started our hike. So, we need to be careful while navigating within the park. I wish they had clearer sign boards.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sunol Regional Park</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sunol regional park is one of the East Bay parks. For more information about the park visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebparks.org/parks/sunol/default.htm&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Extremely light on traffic early in the morning. We took the Flag hill loop trail. It is a short but steep hike promising a wonderful scenery from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Big Island, Hawaii</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of resources on Hawaii online, honestly a bit too much and too many options to choose from. We had spent a lot of time in planning and it still underwent changes until the day of the trip which was bound to happen. In this blog, I have tried to give an almost comprehensive trip for 7 days so as to cover the whole island sufficiently well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Garin Regional Park</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Garin regional park is one of the East Bay parks. It was the best place to see wild flowers blooming all along our path. For more information about the park visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebparks.org/parks/garin/default.htm&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Extremely light on traffic early in the morning. People started coming late for a picnic with family. We saw hardly 10 people hiking in this huge park. They were all spread out. It was a peaceful hike with byfar the most number of sightings of animals/birds in a local hike in Bay area. We saw a lot of cows, by now we have concluded that we had underestimated the timid looking cows. We learnt our lesson to keep our distance from them. Apart from the cows, we also saw a bunch of turkeys on the way. As we came close to the end of our trail we also spotted 2-3 coyotes running from the top of the mountain to the bottom. We were 10ft away from the coyotes. That was fun !&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vargas Plateau</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Vargas plateau is one of the East Bay parks in the Fremont hills. It overlooks Niles Canyon, Fremont, Union city and San Francisco Bay beyond. We went hiking during the month of March 2019 when California in general had good showers during Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mission Peak</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Mission Peak is one of the most popular hikes in the Bay Area if you are looking for some challenge. It is pretty crowded. We went hiking during the month of January when there were showers and there were green grass pastures for the cows to feed on.&lt;/p&gt;
