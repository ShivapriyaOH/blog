  bio: I am a Software Engineer by profession. I love to travel around the world with my equally enthusiastic husband and document our adventures. We go on hikes every weekend in and around the Bay Area, California. This blog is an attempt to bring you the details of those experiences of our travels to mostly not-so-famous places and introduce some hiking places in California which we would like people to go after reading this blog. Life is too short to miss out on the nature's beautiful creations on our planet earth. Go out, explore. If you listen carefully, the mountains are calling !
