  bio: I am a Software Engineer by profession. I love to travel around the world with my equally enthusiastic husband, who also happens to be technology/network security blogger in his freetime. Check out his <a href="https://kulkarniamit.github.io/whatwhyhow/"> website</a>. My blog is an attempt to bring you the details of the experiences of our travels and introduce some hikes in and around California which we would like people to go after reading this blog. Life is too short to miss out on the nature's beautiful creations on our planet earth. Go out, explore. If you listen carefully, the mountains are calling !
