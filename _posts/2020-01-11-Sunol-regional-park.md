Sunol regional park is one of the East Bay parks. For more information about the park visit their [website](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/sunol/default.htm). Extremely light on traffic early in the morning. We took the Flag hill loop trail. It is a short but steep hike promising a wonderful scenery from the top.

Flaghill summit is 1.3 miles and 900 feet above the Sunol headquarters. It's a tough climb up to the top but it gets over soon. 

The view from the top is one of the best in the Bay Area. It is a very peaceful place with hardly any noise. 

Waypoints:

1. The hike begins from the trailhead behind the headquarters. Take the bridge behind the barn across the Alameda Creek. Turn left turn and walk till you see a sign for Flag hill trail.

2. Start climbing up toward Flag hill. This climb is steep and rocky in a few places.

4. At the summit, go ahead to explore the rocks. There is a bench from which the views of the Sunol region is breath taking.
